Hi there,

as this is my first new blog post, I'd like to share some topics I'd really like
to write about. Let's say, this simple jekyll blog on github pages, should server
somehow as a public notebook, todo list, reminder app or something like that regarding my work and personal interests. So the following topics just come out of my mind. Let's start:


* Serverless E-Commerce Applications
* Progressive Web Apps with React
* Checklist for Relaunching an E-Commerce App / Online Shop
* Checklist for manual and automated UI Testing
* The basic UX of E-Commerce Landing Pages, Product Listing and Detail Pages.
* Checkout Best Practices
* Serving static files via cloudfront


That's it for now. Follow me on Twitter or Github to stay tuned.

Best,

carl@frnkn
